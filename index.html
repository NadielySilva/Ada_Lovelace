            <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>Ada Lovelace was born in December the 10 <sup>th</sup> 1815 to a privileged and well-educated family member of the British aristocracy. She was the daughter of the brief marrige between Lord Byron, well known British poet, and Lady Byron - Anne Isabella Noel Byron - a mathematician that was also literated in science, philosophy and literature.</p>
            <p>Although Ada showed great interest towards science since very young, her mother, Lady Byron, was terrified that young Ada followed the footsteps of her father and became a poet. Even before Ada was born, her parent's marrige was wrecked due to philosophycal differences. Lady Byron was amazed by technology and was certan that it was the right path for human kind while Lord Byron did not agree with machines taking place of humans in the workplace. When Augusta Ada Byron was born her father was desapointed about the fact that she was a girl and this was the last straw for Lady and Lord Byron's marrige - just after a month of their daughter's birth Lord Byron took off to Greece to never come back, he died when Ada was 8 years old and father and daughter never get to meet.</p>

            <p>Since very young Ada was inclined towards math, science and tech.Lady Byron made sure she followed this path by literating her in mathematics and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/02/ada-lovelace-emily-howard-composer">music</a>.When Ada was 12 year old she designed a flying machine and was inspired by the studying of birds to design a steam-powered flying machine.</p>
            <p>When Ada was 17 years old she met Mary Somerville, the translator for the French mathematician and physicist Pierre-Simon LaPlace and first woman to enter the Royal Astronomy Society. Mary encouraged Ada to study mathematics and technology. It was through Mary that Ada at 19 years old met Charles Babbage, a visionary scientist who designed the Difference Engine and Analytical Engine - the first general-purpose computer which used punch cards as input and output. They met at a party at Mary's house and Ada was delighted hearing Babbage describing how his Difference Engine would work. However, Ada and Babbage would only partnered up when Ada was 28 years old, by the time she was already married and mother of three children. Ada became ill and was then tutored by London University's first Mathematics Professor, Augustus de Morgan.</p>
            <p>Ada was a brilliant mathematician, dubbed by Charles Babbage as "The Enchantress of number". Her career was not standard for women of her time, she was brilliant yes, but part of her success is derived from opportunities she was afforded that was denied most women of her time. Ada Lovelace died in November 1852 at 36 years old of cancer.</p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>             
            <p>Charles Babbage, although visionary, did not see he's life's work through. The Difference Engine only became reality in 1991 for his 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary and it was only completed, both engine and printer, in 2002. In reprisal to his never finished Difference Engine, Babbage was denied financial support by the British aristocracy. In order to gather the funds for his new project, in 1842, Babbage gave a talk in Turin,Italy, about the functioning of the Analytical Engine. From the talk the italian mathematician Luigi Maneabrea wrote an article summarizing it. He published the article in the same year at the Universal Library of Geneva.</p>
            <p>Ada Lovelace's life's work was built upon the translation of Maneabrea's article to English. After she finished translating it, she corresponded with Babbage and he suggested that she added her own notes to it. A year and many letters later she finished her work in 1843. By then she understood the functioning of the Analytical Engine as well as its creator. She went beyond her mentor and envisioned that a machine that could manipulate numbers could manipulate any data.</p>
            <p>The translation of Maneabrea's article and her notes ended up having three times te size of the original article. She suggested that the machine could be used to create complex musics, accurate graphs and could be used for both emphirical and scientific development.</p>
            <p>Ada made seven notes and comments on the article in total going from 'A' to 'G'. The last note 'Notes G' concludes her thouths on Babbage's engine and she suggests that the machine could be used to calculate <a href="https://www.bernoulli.org">Bernoulli's number</a>. She describes a stepwise sequence of operations to get the calculations done and this is known today to be the firt algorithm to be written.</p>
            <p>In spite her short life, Ada Lovelace is responsible for much of the modern scientific and technological development. By understending that Babbage's machine was capable of much more than what he envisioned it for, she took humanity from calculation to computation, she understood how to make it do the things computers do today.</p>

                    <li><p>In 2009 was celebrated the first "Ada Lovelace Day". In that year, the Day was celebrated on March, however the Ada Lovelace Day is now celebrated in the second Tuesday of October and it is meant to be the day set aside to learn about women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Surrounded by Stars</h3></li>
                    <li><p>Besides Charles Babbage,<a href="http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/ada-bio.html">Ada's social life</a>  included Sir David Brewster (he invented the kaleidoscope), Charles Wheatstone, Charles Dickens and Michel Faraday.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Work hard, play hard</h3></li>
                    <li><p>Ada gave her family nightmares when she started <a href="https://blog.betrybe.com/tecnologia/ada-lovelace/">gambling</a> . She drowned herself in debts to the point of losing some of her heirdoms diamonds. She even set up an association meant to develop a program to predict race results</p></li>
